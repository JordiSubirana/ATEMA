# ATEMA

**ATEMA** (_**A**dvanced **T**ools **E**ngine for **M**ultimedia **A**pplications_) is a portable and modular C++11 library providing many tools for the development of multimedia programs.  
This software is provided under MIT license. See [this website](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) or the file [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/JordiSubirana/ATEMA/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) for more informations.

## Ambitions

The goal of **ATEMA** is to provide a simple, intuitive and efficient API in order to allow developers to easily create multimedia programs, such as 2D/3D games, parallel computations on GPU, and more.

## Dependencies

As many dependencies as possible are header-only libraries. The exhaustive list is :  
* stb_image (see [nothings/stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) on GitHub)
* stb_image_write (see [nothings/stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) on GitHub)
* TinyJPEG (see [serge-rgb/TinyJPEG](https://github.com/serge-rgb/TinyJPEG) on GitHub)
* tinyobjloader (see [syoyo/tinyobjloader](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader) on GitHub)
* glad (see [Dav1dde/glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) on GitHub)

## Modules

**ATEMA** is designed to be modular. This means you can use each module independently, based on what you exactly need. The different modules are :

## Platforms

This software is designed to be portable and all the modules should work on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX.

## Install

A _premake_ system allow you to easily build the library of each module and a global one.
The only prerequisite is a compatible C++11 compiler.

## Examples

_Some more screenshots will appear there soon._
